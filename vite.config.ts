/**
 * Vite's main focus is on startup speed, so it doesn't check your package.json to see which dependencies you have at startup.
 * When it spots a file that imports a dependency, it optimizes that dependency on the fly and reloads the page. If I use something
 * that relies on another dependency, like lucide-react depending on react, it has to optimize lucide first and then reoptimize react
 * since lucide depends on react. It might have tree-shaken something lucide was using.
 *
 * This works fine in local development because it sends the websocket events quickly. But I noticed that if there's a decent gap
 * between the HMR update event and the HMR full-reload event (over ~500ms), it tries to use the new dependencies before the page reloads.
 * React throws an "invalid hook call" error in this case because there are now two different versions of react in play—the one it
 * initially rendered with and the newly optimized version.
 *
 * So we force Vite optimize all dependencies upfront at startup. This way, we avoid having to reoptimize dependencies on file
 * changes and reload the page. Since we have so few dependencies, the impact on startup speed is minimal.
 *
 * Belt-and-braces: we also explicitly include `react-dom` (bare) and `react-dom/server` so that subpath imports
 * pulled in by other deps (e.g. SSR-aware libraries, error boundaries) don't trigger a separate re-optimization
 * pass for react-dom, which would land it on a different `?v=` hash than `react` and cause the "two versions of
 * React" race documented above.
